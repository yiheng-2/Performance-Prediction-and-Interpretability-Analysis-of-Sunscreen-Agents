# Performance-Prediction-and-Interpretability-Analysis-of-Sunscreen-Agents
This dataset contains the formulation ratios of commonly used sunscreens and five performance metrics. Three machine learning models were established to predict sunscreen performance, and interpretability analysis was conducted via SHAP, providing a new method for sunscreen formulation optimization.
